PrinterJacking_SolutionSecurity - Network Printer Security Auditor
( TheLatestUpdate.sh to use )
### **ðŸ”¥ What Problem Does This Solve?**
PrinterGhost addresses a critical enterprise security gap: malicious printer impersonation attacks (PrintJacking). Most organizations overlook network printers as potential attack vectors, leaving them vulnerable to:

1. Data exfiltration through fake print servers

2. Lateral movement within corporate networks

3. Man-in-the-middle attacks on print jobs

4. Credential theft via SMB relay attacks

5. Ransomware deployment through printer vulnerabilities

### **ðŸš€ Quick Start**
**Prerequisites**
```
# Install required tools
sudo apt update && sudo apt install nmap

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/whitegertsok/PrinterJacking_SolutionSecurity.git
cd PrinterJacking_SolutionSecurity
```
**Basic Usage**
```
# Make script executable
chmod +x PrinterSolutionSecurityEN.sh

# Run with default settings
sudo ./PrinterSolutionSecurityEN.sh
```
**Advanced Scanning**
```
# Scan specific network
sudo NETWORK="10.0.0.0/24" ./PrinterSolutionSecurityEN.sh

# Custom interface and log location
sudo INTERFACE="eth1" LOG_DIR="/var/log/YOUR_PLACE" ./PrinterSolutionSecurityEN.sh
```
### **ðŸ“‹ Comprehensive Guide**
**Configuration Options**
```
# Network settings
NETWORK="192.168.1.0/24"          # Your network range
INTERFACE="eth0"                  # Network interface
SCAN_DELAY="1s"                   # Scan timing

# Brand whitelist (ADD YOUR PRINTER BRANDS HERE)
PRINTER_BRANDS="HP|Canon|Xerox|Epson|Brother|Ricoh|Kyocera"

# Blacklist (suspicious brands)
BLACKLIST_BRANDS="Unknown|Generic|Fake"
```
### **ðŸ‘£Multi-level check** 
The script uses cascading analysis, which dramatically increases the accuracy of the detection:
```
Level 1 (Network): Detection of all active hosts.

Level 2 (Ports): Filtering devices with open printer ports (9100/tcp, 515/tcp, 631/tcp).

Level 3 (OS and Services): Deep scanning to determine the actual OS (-O) and software (-sV). This is a nuclear test: if Windows/Linux is running on port 9100, it is a 99% sign of an attack.

Level 4 (Scripts): Use Nmap scripts (printer-info, ipp-enum) to collect additional evidence.

Level 5 (PJL verification): Final verification by sending a PJL command. A real printer will respond, but a fake device will not or will respond with nonsense. This is definitive proof.
