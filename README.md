PrinterJacking_SolutionSecurity - Network Printer Security Auditor
### **ðŸ”¥ What Problem Does This Solve?**
PrinterGhost addresses a critical enterprise security gap: malicious printer impersonation attacks (PrintJacking). Most organizations overlook network printers as potential attack vectors, leaving them vulnerable to:

1. Data exfiltration through fake print servers

2. Lateral movement within corporate networks

3. Man-in-the-middle attacks on print jobs

4. Credential theft via SMB relay attacks

5. Ransomware deployment through printer vulnerabilities
